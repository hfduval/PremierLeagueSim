# Introduction

---

This is a C++ project that simulates all 34 matchweeks of the 2021/22 English Premier Leauge Season.
I created this project because the season is just starting, and I am an avid soccer fan. 
Additionally, I used this project to get some more experience working with C++ components, and Microsoft
Visual Studio. I had a lot of fun spending the end of my summer working on this project, and I hope you
enjoy it!

# Technologies

*Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
*C++14

# Setup

---

I recommend using any C++ compiler to launch the program. It needs to have access all the header files, cpp files and the text file.
Additionally, there are 2 necessary inputs. The first one is an integer between 1-20 that the user inputs in order to select a club
to support. The second input is an integer between 1-34 that allows the user to select a specific matchweek to take a look at.

This project is complete for the moment as I am going back to school for the semester, but further improvements
will be implemented in the future.
